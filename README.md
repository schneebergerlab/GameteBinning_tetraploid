GameteBinning_tetraploid (still need updating 20210714)
=
Here we introduce the pipeline for gamete binning in tetraploid genomes, a method based on single-cell sequencing of gamete genomes to achieve chromosome-level and haplotype-resolved genome assembly of a heterozygous species. This is to support the analysis in [Sun_and_Jiao_et_al_2021](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.15.444292v1).
